If you're using git for version control, don't forget about the `.gitignore` file. Anything large and static (like .abfs) or procedurally generated (e.g. plots) you can toss in the `.gitignore` and you'll not see it when you commit.

I have tabular data that lives in `./inst/extdata/` is processed by a script and then saved as a .rds in `./data/`. Here's my `.gitignore`.

``` r
.Rproj.user
.Rhistory
.RData
.Ruserdata
# Don't track ABFs -- large and static
*.abf
# Don't track files that are generated from the scripts
/data/*
```
