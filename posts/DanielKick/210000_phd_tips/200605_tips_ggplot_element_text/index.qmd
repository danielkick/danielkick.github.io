ggplot's, `element_text()` comes with a color argument. Why does that matter? It doesn't just accept atomics, you can hand it a *vector*! This effectively gives one access to conditional formatting. This works on `ggplot2_3.3.0` but "vectorized input to `element_text()` is not officially supported" so YMMV with newer versions.

Here's an example I think it makes an otherwise unbearable figure a little more so without requiring duplicated labels.

One thing to be aware of is the ordering of a character/ factor may differ between a data.frame and the plot. In the visualized example, I had `mRNA` as type character instead of factor so it got alphabetized when it was plotted rather than by the order appearing in the data.frame. ![image (8).png](image%20(8).png)
