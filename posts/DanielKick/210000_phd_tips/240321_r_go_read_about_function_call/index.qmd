[This](https://blog.moertel.com/posts/2006-01-20-wondrous-oddities-rs-function-call-semantics.html) is the sort of thing you don’t realize until it would be *really* useful to access the name of a variable or run text as if it were code. I think the most accessible example of R’s wizardry is in plotting- you pass variables (time, mv) to plot or ggplot instead of strings (“time”, “mv”) and magically you get axis labels. R gets access to the *value* of a variable *and* its name and no one notices because it just works.
