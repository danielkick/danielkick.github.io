R's distribution simulation functions (e.g. `dbinom`, `runif`) make it
quick and easy to double check one's intuitions. For example, I'd been
thinking that under H0 the distribution of correlations from normal
samples should drop off sharply as you go away from 0 such that a shift
in correlation from 0 -\> 0.1 is much more likely than 0.8 -\> 0.9.

So I used `purrr::map()` to run a quick simulation. Here we simulate the
null distribution based on 100,000 observations and compute the chance
of a value being above 0.7. If it was uniform we would expect \~15%
(.03/2) of the distribution to be here but end up with \~1.2% with the
drop off.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(89745) 
cor_check <- map(1:100000, function(i){ 
  cor(rnorm(10), rnorm(10), method = "pearson") 
}) 
cor_check <- data.frame(cor = do.call(rbind, cor_check))

mean(cor_check$cor >= 0.7)*100 
#1.227 Percent 
```

```{r}
ggplot(cor_check, aes(x = cor))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05) 
```
