[`fuzzywuzzy`](https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy) is a tool that isn’t necessary most of the time but when it is it can save a ton of time. It lets you do approximate string matching. I’ve used it for handling typos and differences in white space/punctuation/naming conventions in entry labels and it’s worked nicely. There’s a port for R and a few other languages too.
