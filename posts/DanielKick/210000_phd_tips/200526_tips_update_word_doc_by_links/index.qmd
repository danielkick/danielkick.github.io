Handy trick: Write your test results into a summary csv. Then while writing you can insert a link to the cell value for a result into your .doc. After that, changing post hoc corrections, re-sampling iterations, or data QC just requires you to re-run your code and let word refresh all the links.

You can also do this from excel, but you'll have to update the formula for the cell used instead.
