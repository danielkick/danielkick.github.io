Don't get suckered when converting factors! Numeric data can be assigned to a factor type which will throw a wrench in a plot or analysis (1/3) ![image (2).png](image%20(2).png)

A knee jerk reaction would be to convert it to a numeric with `as.numeric()`. That doesn't work either. (2/3) ![image (3).png](image%20(3).png)

However if you use `as.numeric(as.character())` then it works. That's because factors are ordinal and named so if you convert the type to character first to ensure R is working with the factor names instead of the ranks. (3/3) ![image (4).png](image%20(4).png)
