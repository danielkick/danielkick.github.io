In tidyverse you can use `.` to reference the current dataframe. This is
really useful for plotting. For example, I'd like to plot channels In7
and In12 in that order but by default In12 will come first. We could
save an intermediate dataframe and re-level the factors, but by
referencing the dataframe piped into mutate we can skip this step.

``` r
temp %>% # temp is a down-sampled ephys recording
  ungroup() %>% 
  gather(key, value, c("In7", "In12")) %>% 
  mutate(key = factor(.$key, levels = c("In7", "In12"))) %>%      # Note that if you have groupings, you'll need to get rid of them or supply a column of the same length as the group. 
  ggplot(aes(Time, value, color = key, group = interaction(key, Sweep)))+
  geom_path()
```
