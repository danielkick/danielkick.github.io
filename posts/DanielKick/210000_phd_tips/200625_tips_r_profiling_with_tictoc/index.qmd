The `tictoc` library has convenience functions for timing code. Here’s
the basic usage relative to timing with base R.

``` r
library(tictoc)
tic()
# code here
toc()

tic <- Sys.time()
# code here
toc <- Sys.time()
print(toc - tic)
```

Where this library excels is when you want to time multiple parts of
your code. Each `tic` pushes the time onto a stack and each `toc` pops
the most recent time from said stack. That means you don’t have to worry
about assigning several timing variables even if you want to time nested
code.

``` r
tic()
# stack is 1 deep
for (i in 1:10) {
     tic()
     # stack is now 2 deep
     for (j in 1:10){
          tic()
          # stack is now 3 deep
          toc()
     }
     toc()
}
toc()
```
