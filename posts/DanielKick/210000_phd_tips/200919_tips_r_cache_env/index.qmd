If you're working on data that takes a long time to process, consider
adding a the following to your analysis.

``` r
save.image(file='myEnvironment.RData')
load('myEnvironment.RData')
```

This will let you reload your environment. One can also by default save
your environment when closing Rstudio but that may make it easy to
reference objects that no longer are generated in the document itself
thereby speeding software rot.
