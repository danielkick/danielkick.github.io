You can keep your working `Rmd` easier to navigate and less buggy by 1) packaging code into functions and 2) adding them to a companion `R`file. Load your functions with `source()` in the same block you load your libraries with a relative path, full path, or ideally with `here()`.

``` r
library(here)
source(here("R", "02MoniterGapJunction.R")) #here's output is effectively ../R/02MoniterGapJunction.R
```
