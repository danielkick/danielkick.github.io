If you're iteratively making plots, resampling, or doing another task that would have your reach for a for loop or `lapply()` use `furrr::future_map()` instead. `furrr` gives parallel processing ready versions of tidyverse's `purrr` functions (e.g. `map()`, `walk()`). It's easy to install the dependencies and takes a lot of the headache out of parallel processing.
