Python quirk I just learned and think is worth sharing. *A missing valued doesn't equal itself.*

Here's the context: I'm making a list of values from a column that could not be converted to a date. Missing values can't be converted so they end up in the list (e.g. `[nan, '7/5/21 for pass 2']`. So how do we discard this empty value? We use a list comprehension to see if the value is equal to itself ( `[val for val in my_list if val == val]` ) and will get a nan free list.
