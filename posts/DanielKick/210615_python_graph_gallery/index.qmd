[This](https://www.python-graph-gallery.com/ "https://www.python-graph-gallery.com/") or similar sites can be helpful for looking up the right code/library for a plot. You can also find library specific ones. ([matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html "https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html"), [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/ "https://plotly.com/python/"))

One of R's main plotting libraries, ggplot2, describes plots by layering one component on top of another (e.g. starting with x and y variables, adding points, adding error bars, adding aesthetic adjustments). If that sort of approach appeals to you there is a python version of this library called plotnine ([github](https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine "https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine"), [example use](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/07-visualization-ggplot-python/index.html "https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/07-visualization-ggplot-python/index.html")).
