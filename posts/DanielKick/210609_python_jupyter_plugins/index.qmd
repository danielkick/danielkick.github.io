I came across a handy set of tools for jupyter. There are of extensions for the notebooks that give you access to code snips, autocomplete by default, rendering a notebook as a slide show, and other features. To get it installed within an anaconda virtual environment you may only need to install it with this command:

`conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions`

I not all of the extensions were showing up for me until I also ran these two lines, so it may take a bit of fiddling to get it to run.

```         
jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
jupyter nbextension enable codefolding/main
```
