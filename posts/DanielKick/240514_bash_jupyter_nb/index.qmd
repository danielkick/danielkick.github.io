Much of what I write is in notebooks (thanks to the lovely [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) library) but there are times where this is not convenient. For instance, while tuning hyperparameters or running other processes that can take a long time, it would be useful to detach a notebook from my IDE while it's running. One dead simple way to do this on linux is with the "no hangup" command (`nohup`).

All we have to do is: 1. activate the enviroment:

`$ conda activate my_env`

2.  use `jupyter` to create a python script from the desired notebook: `(my_env) $ jupyter nbconvert --to python my_notebook.ipynb`

3.  run the notebook (in our environment) with `nohup` so that the shell can be disconnected and `&` to run the command in the background `(my_env) $ nohup python ./my_notebook &`

*Et voil√†!* The process shows up on the GPU and we don't have to worry about a bad internet connection or anything else stopping it before it's finished.
