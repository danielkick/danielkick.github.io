-   I provide assistance with project management, statistics, and programming to Dr. Michael Gray, Dr. Benton Berigan, and Sherryl Henderson (PhDc) in their study of neuronal property changes following spinal cord injury. (In Preparation) ([Github](https://github.com/danielkick/MouseMPGSCI))

-   In an ongoing collaboration, I provide analysis and domain expertise (along with Dr. David Schulz) to Dr. Satish Nair's engineering lab. (In Preparation) 

-   Collaborating Dr. Adam J Northcutt, who acted as the biological lead on this project, I trained and evaluated machine learning models to classify neurons by their mRNA expression profiles. (Published in [PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1911413116)), [GitHub](https://github.com/danielkick/STGmRNACellClassification) )


-   Working with Dr. Brian Lane, I assisted with figure generation and analysis of physiological data. (Published in [Elife](https://elifesciences.org/articles/39368))
