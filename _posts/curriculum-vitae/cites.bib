               have variable membrane conductance magnitudes even within the
               same individual, yet produce identical synchronized activity in
               the intact network. In a previous study we blocked a subset of
               K+ conductances across LCs, resulting in loss of synchronous
               activity (Lane et al., 2016). In this study, we hypothesized
               that this same variability of conductances makes LCs vulnerable
               to desynchronization during neuromodulation. We exposed the LCs
               to serotonin (5HT) and dopamine (DA) while recording
               simultaneously from multiple LCs. Both amines had distinct
               excitatory effects on LC output, but only 5HT caused
               desynchronized output. We further determined that DA rapidly
               increased gap junctional conductance. Co-application of both
               amines induced 5HT-like output, but waveforms remained
               synchronized. Furthermore, DA prevented desynchronization
               induced by the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA),
               suggesting that dopaminergic modulation of electrical coupling
               plays a protective role in maintaining network synchrony.",
